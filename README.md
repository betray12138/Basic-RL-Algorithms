## Basic-RL-Algorithms 

### Description
This project is used to implement all kinds of RL basic algorithms.

## File Structure
1. **algo** to save the code regarding the algorithms' implementations
2. **docs** to save the descriptions of the corresponding algorithms
3. **env** to provide the env_wrapper (gym, gymnasium)
4. **model** to save the network structure of policy, state-value function, action-value function
5. **util** to save the code regrading the common tricks


## The implemented algorithms
1. A2C (A2C Continuous / A2C Discrete)
2. DDPG
3. RainBow-DQN(initial, double, PER, )

## How to use
we provide the environment.yaml, and you can import it with anaconda like: 

`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

`conda activate yours`
